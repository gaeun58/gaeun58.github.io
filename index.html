</a><strong>A city is a large human settlement.</strong>[2][3][a] It can be defined 
as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively 
defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural 
tasks.[4] Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, 
transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, 
and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between 
people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting 
different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of 
goods and service distribution. Due to the efficiency of transportation
 the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to 
 have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely
  populated areas.[5] Therefore, compact cities are often referred 
  to as a crucial element of fighting climate change.[6] However, 
  this concentration can also have significant negative consequences,
   such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, 
   and stressing water supplies and other resources.</p>
