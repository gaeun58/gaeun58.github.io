    Busan (Korean pronunciation: [pusan]), formerly romanized as Pusan 
    and now officially known as Busan Metropolitan City, is South
     Korea's second-most populous city after Seoul, with a population 
     of over 3.4 million inhabitants.[3] It is the economic, cultural 
     and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its 
     port—Korea's busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world.[a] 
     The surrounding "Southeast Economic Zone" (including Ulsan and 
     South Gyeongsang) is South Korea's largest industrial area.</p>

<p style="margin-top:25px;"> Busan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[5] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.</p></body></html>
